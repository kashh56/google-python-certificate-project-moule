# Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate - Python Projects 🐍📊

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase the projects completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. This repository includes detailed work on three data analysis projects using Python. Each project involved creating Jupyter notebooks and executive summaries to present the findings. Below you'll find an overview of each project, the objectives, and the deliverables.

## 🚖 Automatidata - NYC Taxi Fare Analysis

### 📚 **Project Overview:**
In the Automatidata project, the objective was to analyze the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission data to understand factors affecting taxi fares. The analysis involved preparing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and setting up for hypothesis testing to compare fare amounts based on payment methods.

### 🔍 **Project Details:**
- **Objective**: Investigate whether there is a significant difference in average fare amounts between customers who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Understand the Situation**: Organize and prepare the dataset for analysis.
  2. **Understand the Data**: Create a pandas dataframe, perform a cursory inspection, and compile summary information.
  3. **Understand the Variables**: Investigate specific variables for deeper insights.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
 Detailed analysis .
 Summary of findings and insights.
